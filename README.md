# Express.js-Response-HTML-Table-Generator
This client-side module is made to work together with Axios post requests and express response objects. It analyzes responses and generates tables complete with any desired headers, search boxes (optional), and even pagination (optional)! Front-end developers, spend less time writing code and more time designing!
